Pokemon Sprites
===

Pokemon games sprites and icons through generations and games. Dumped with [this script](https://github.com/aleperaltabazas/dex-scripts/tree/master/dex-assets), with sprites taken from [PokeAPI](https://github.com/pokeapi/sprites) and icons from [Pokencyclopedia](https://www.pokencyclopedia.info/).

## TODO

* Animated icons
* Numbered and named icons and sprites
* Shinies?
